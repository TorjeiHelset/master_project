Short explanation of the network configurations described in the different files
This folder consists of two types of files, network_x.json files and config_x_y.json files.
The network files contain the number of internal cells to be used for every 25 metres, as well 
as the total time of the simulation. In addition it contains starting points for the speed limits and the 
cycle times for the traffic lights. 
The speed limits may vary in time, in which case both of the speed limits as well as the time
it changes need to be specified.

The configuration files describe in more detail the initial and boundary conditions being used in one
of the networks in the network files.
We assume a constant density on each road, but this density may vary from road to road. The config 
file specifies the initial densities on all roads.
In addition it specifies parameters used for the boundary conditions. In most cases we make use of a 
step function.

Network files:
    1:
        Small network for the purposes of testing that optimization works as intended
        For this network the cell size is 12.5 metres
        Upper and lower speed limits are 20 and 50 km/h for every road (also roundabouts)
        Upper and lower times for red and green lights are 10 and 200 seconds
        The total simulation time is 30 seconds

    2:
        For this network the cell size is 12.5 metres
        Upper and lower speed limits are 20 and 50 km/h for every road (also roundabouts)
        Upper and lower times for red and green lights are 10 and 200 seconds
        The total simulation time is 750 seconds
        The speed limits may change after 10 minutes
        All cycles of traffic lights only consists of two times
        The total number of parameters being optimized is 
        7 * 2 + 13 * 2 = 40
        (7 different speed limits that may change in time and 13 traffic lights each with two
        parameters)

    3:
        Similar network as 1-1, but with smaller cell sizes and longer simulation time
        For this network the cell size is 5 metres
        Upper and lower speed limits are 20 and 50 km/h for every road (also roundabouts)
        Upper and lower times for red and green lights are 10 and 200 seconds
        The total simulation time is 1 hour
        The speed limits may change every 10 minutes
        The total number of parameters being optimized is 
        7*6 + 13*2 = 68

    4:
        Similar network as 1-1, but with smaller cell sizes and longer simulation time
        For this network the cell size is 5 metres
        Upper and lower speed limits are 20 and 50 km/h for every road (also roundabouts)
        Upper and lower times for red and green lights are 10 and 200 seconds
        The total simulation time is 3 hours
        The speed limits may change every 30 minutes
        The total number of parameters being optimized is 68

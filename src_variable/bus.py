'''
So far roads/junctions have not had global positions, but only relative positions
The fact that a bus follows a specific route, means that this approach might not be
good enough.
Two options:

1. Introduce a global coordinate system, and a mapping between coordinates and roads/junctions
 - This will entail at least some rewriting of the existing code

2. Introduce a route object, that needs to be able to map a length of the route to a 
position in the road system.

- Each road/junction could have an id, and the route could then know at what lengths of the 
bus route corresponds to what id-s.
- This requires minimal rewriting of the existing code.
- The route could still have a global position, as long as it is able to map from id to 
global position. Might be more work than it is worth.


The simplest might be for the bus to only have a length as position, and then the 
route object can map from length to road/junction. The route object will also know at 
what position on the specified road the bus is at.

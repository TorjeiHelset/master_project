        Single Lane Network
    </h2>
    <p>
        The video below shows the results for the single lane network. The blue square represents the bus with 
        non-optimal control parameters, and the green square represents the bus with optimal control parameters.
        The amount of traffic is represented by a red color scale. White means there is no traffic, and full ref 
        means the road is congested. The density on the road is the density from the simulation with optimal control
        parameters.

        Single Junction Network
    </h2>

        The video below shows the results for the single junction network. The blue square represents the bus with 
        non-optimal control parameters, and the green square represents the bus with optimal control parameters.
        The amount of traffic is represented by a red color scale. White means there is no traffic, and full ref 
        means the road is congested. The density on the road is the density from the simulation with optimal control

        Two-to-two Junction Network
    </h2>
    <p>
        The video below shows the results for the two-to-two junction network. The two blue squares represents the buses with 
        non-optimal control parameters, and the green squares represents the buses with optimal control parameters.
        The amount of traffic is represented by a red color scale. White means there is no traffic, and full ref 
        means the road is congested. The density on the road is the density from the simulation with optimal control
        parameters. In this network we assume that all of the traffic from the left road enters the right road, and that
        all of the traffic from the top road enters the bottom road. The junction is controlled by a traffic light.

        Larger Network

    <p>
        The video below shows the results for a larger traffic-flow network. The blue squares represents the buses with 
        non-optimal control parameters, and the green squares represents the buses with optimal control parameters.
        The amount of traffic is represented by a red color scale. White means there is no traffic, and full ref 
        means the road is congested. The density on the road is the density from the simulation with optimal control
        parameters. In this network we assume that all of the traffic from the left road enters the right road, and that
        all of the traffic from the top road enters the bottom road. The junction is controlled by a traffic light.

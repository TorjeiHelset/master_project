        This is a repository containing the code associated with my Master Thesis. This homepage contains some animations
        showing some of the results. For all the examples considered, the densities on each road is represented by a red
        color scale. A white color means that there is no traffic, and a darker red color means that there is heavy traffic.
        The exmples compare how efficiently buses are able to drive through different traffic-flow networks for different choices
        of control parameters. In all cases we try to minimize the average delay of the buses. The traffic shown in the network as well
        is the traffic from the simulation when optimal control parameters was chosen. The green squares show the positions of the buses for 
        optimal control parameters. In order to compare this with the non-optimal control parameters the optimizaiton algorithm was started from
        we also show the corresponding positions of the buses at the same times when non-optimal control paramters was chosen. These buses are
        visualized by the blue squares. These are added just to compare the different choices. We do not show the corresponding traffic on the roads
        for non-optimal control parameters. We also show the locations of the bus stops by a bus stop icon. We note that the positions of these icons
        might not match perfectly with the actual locations of the stops.

        The first example we consider is a network consisting of only one road. The starting speed limit was chosen as 
        20 km/h, and the best speed limit found was 50 km/h.

        The second example we consider is a traffic-flow network consisting of two roads connected in a junction. The 
        traffic across this junction is controlled by a traffic light. In this case we need to determine good speed limits,
        as well as good settings for the traffic lights. A comparison of the initial guess for the control parameters and the 
        best choice of control parameters can be seen in the video below.

        We now consider a traffic-flow network consisting of four roads connected in a 2-to-2 junction.
        The traffic crossing the junction is controlled by a traffic light. In this example we consider two
        different bus lines.

        We increase the complexity by adding a roundabout, as well as more roads and junctions. We also increase the number of
        bus lines adding a thirds bus line. The bottom left junction is controlled by a traffic light, while the traffic crossing
        the two other junctions are determined only using yielding rules.

        The most complex network we consider is a simplified approximation of Kvadraturen in Kristiandsand. We only model the roads
        where we assume there is most traffic, as well as a portion of e18. We consider a total of six different bus lines. The simulation is 
        performed for a total of 750 seconds. In order to get a more interesting minimization problem, we have exaggerated the number of buses
        travelling through the network.
